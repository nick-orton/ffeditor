# ffeditor

A terminal UI tool for managing a digital music collection. Browse your
filesystem, convert audio formats, and edit ID3 tags — all from the
terminal.

## Requirements

- Go 1.22 or later
- `ffmpeg` on `$PATH` (required for audio conversion)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable (required for smart tag
  lookup)

## Build

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nick-orton/ffeditor
cd ffeditor
make
```

## Testing

```sh
make test       # all tests (unit + integration)
make test-short # unit tests only; skips ffmpeg conversion tests
```

Integration tests require `ffmpeg` on `$PATH` and are skipped
automatically when it is absent or when `-short` is passed. On the
first run with ffmpeg available, `TestMain` generates
`testdata/silence.opus` so the fixture is ready for subsequent runs.

## Usage

```sh
./ffeditor [directory]
```

Opens the file browser in the given directory, or the current working
directory if none is provided.

## Command Bar

Press `:` to open the command bar. Type a command and press `Enter` to
execute, or `Esc` to cancel.

| Command      | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `:edit`      | Edit tags for selected `.mp3` / `.flac` file(s)  |
| `:tag`       | Synonym for `:edit`                              |
| `:convert`   | Convert selected audio files to `.mp3`           |
| `:cd <path>` | Navigate to a directory                          |
| `:q`         | Quit                                             |

### Tab completion

Tab completion works in two contexts:

**Command names** — press `Tab` with a partial command name to cycle
through matching commands alphabetically:

```text
:c<Tab>      → :cd
:c<Tab>      → :convert
:c<Tab>      → :cd          (wraps around)
:e<Tab>      → :edit
```

Any other keystroke accepts the current completion and ends the cycle.

**Directory paths** — while typing a `:cd` command, press `Tab` to
complete directory names:

- Completes to the longest common prefix of matching directories
- Appends `/` when there is exactly one match, so you can keep tabbing
  deeper
- Works with absolute paths, relative paths, and `~`

### `:cd` path syntax

- `:cd` — go to home directory
- `:cd ~` or `:cd ~/music` — `~` expands to your home directory
- `:cd /absolute/path` — absolute path
- `:cd relative/path` — relative to current directory

## Audio Conversion

Select one or more audio files (or a directory containing
them) and run `:convert`. Converted `.mp3` files are written alongside
the originals. Source files are not deleted.

- **Bulk**: selecting a directory recursively finds all convertible
  files and converts them sequentially, showing `Converting N/M...`
  progress in the status bar.
- **Skip**: files that already have a corresponding `.mp3` are skipped
  automatically.
- **Cancel**: press `Ctrl+C` during a conversion to kill the current
  ffmpeg process and stop the queue. Files already converted are kept.
  The browser returns to normal immediately.
- **No ffmpeg**: if `ffmpeg` is not found on `$PATH`, the app opens
  normally and `:convert` shows an error in the status bar.
- **Supported Formats**: `.opus`, `.m4a`, `.ogg`

## Tag Editing

Select one or more `.mp3` or `.flac` files and press `e` (or run
`:edit` / `:tag`) to open the tag editor. MP3 files use ID3 tags;
FLAC files use Vorbis Comments — both expose the same six fields.

```text

│ track01.mp3                           │
╰───────────────────────────────────────╯

  Up/Down: navigate   Tab: complete   Ctrl+T: smart tags
  Ctrl+S: save   Esc: cancel
```

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` | Move between fields |
| `Tab` | Complete current word from filename tokens (cycles) |
| `Ctrl+T` | Smart tag lookup (single file only) |
| `Ctrl+S` | Save changes and return to browser |
| `Esc` | Discard changes and return to browser |

**Tab completion** splits the filename on non-alphanumeric characters
(underscores, hyphens, spaces, etc.) to build a token list. Pressing
`Tab` while typing a word completes it from matching tokens; repeated
`Tab` presses cycle through all matches.

**Smart tag lookup** (`Ctrl+T`, single file only): sends the filename
to Claude Haiku, which guesses Artist, Title, and Year. Any blank
fields are pre-filled with the result; non-blank fields are left
unchanged. A spinner shows in the status bar while the model runs.
Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to be set.

**Bulk tagging**: select multiple `.mp3` or `.flac` files (or a mix)
before running `:edit`.
Fields shared by every selected file are pre-filled; differing fields
start blank. Only fields you fill in are written — blank fields are
left unchanged on every file. The Title field is disabled in bulk
mode (shown dimmed) to prevent accidental overwriting of individual
track titles. Useful for stamping a shared Artist or Album across a
whole album at once.

## Smart Tags from Browser

Press `Ctrl+T` in the file browser to automatically fill missing tags
for the selected `.mp3` or `.flac` file(s) without opening the tag
editor.

- Sends each file's basename to Claude Haiku, which guesses Artist,
  Title, and Year from the filename.
- Only **empty** fields are written. Any tag already set on the file
  is left unchanged.
- A spinner shows `Applying smart tags...` in the status bar while
  the API calls run. Input is blocked during this time.
- On completion: `Smart tags applied (N files)` shown in status bar.
- Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to be set in the environment. An error
  is shown in the status bar if the key is missing or the API fails.
